# VR Deals
This project finds the best offers on the internet around the topic VR. I use Python to collect the data, store them in a MySQL database and present them with the web framework Flask.

I have created a simple bootstrap layout for prototyping. The project is still in a very early stage of development, most of the features are not yet implemented.
